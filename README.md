## Day 1 July 7 2024 Research  Cybersecurity Microniches

My primary objective during the launch phase was to locate microniches. After extensive searching, I have decided to concentrate on Web security audits and API security audits. To minimize expenses, I intend to utilize all available resources from Microsoft programs.
